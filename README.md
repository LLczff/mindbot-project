# This project is use for the job application at MindBot.

* I face some problems about Docker. Unlike the local machine, it seems to not write on db.txt when using register api.
* I didn't have time to make a reservation note as text file and import to create a seat map. So, I hardcoded it exactly the same as in the question.
* Please feel free to feedback about my solution :D
